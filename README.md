Nowadays, using Deep Learning techniques for classification
problems is in high demand. This project aims to
build some of the well-known deep neural networks on the
handwritten forensic data set generated at CDAC
Kolkata. The aim of this project is to find out the optimal DL
method which properly describes and identifies the
highest classification accuracy of the proprietary data set
generated at CDAC.
